Technology used: Tinkercad\
Code by Blocks\
Use the sensor to open the barrier automatically when a vehicle enters and exits. There is a light indicator to show whether the parking lot is available or full. There are lights indicating which parking spaces are available and which are occupied. When a vehicle enters the parking lot, the parking time will be calculated and the amount to be paid upon the vehicle's exit from the parking area.\
